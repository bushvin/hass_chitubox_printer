        :warning:
        Verify first that your issue is not [already reported on
        GitHub](../search?q=is%3Aissue&type=issues) and keep in mind that we may have to keep
        the current behavior because [every change breaks someone's workflow](https://xkcd.com/1172/).
        We try to be mindful about this.
